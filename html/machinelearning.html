            One of the most exciting prospects in the realm of Computer Science is Machine Learning and Artificial
            Intelligence. How does a computer become intelligent? It starts with huge amounts of data being fed into
            computers. This data is somehow, over a considerable period of time, understood and learnt by the computer
            and this is followed by the computer developing some kind of intelligence. Although this is a more than
            simplified view of the whole process, it gives us a very basic understanding of the intuition behind the
            whole process.<br>
            Personally, the intermediate step of Machine Learning is the most intriguing. This, along with the high
            involvement of algorithms in Machine Learning, gave me the perfect opportunity to write about the basics of
            Machine Learning in this project.<br>
            I want to provide a basic overview of ML algorithms in this part of my project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we begin, there are three types of ML algorithms: supervised learning algorithms, unsupervised
            learning algorithms and reinforcement learning algorithms.<br>
            Supervised learning algorithms usually consist of independent variables as input and dependent variables as
            output which are predicted from the input. The learning process continues until the model reaches a
            particular level of accuracy.<br>
            Unsupervised learning algorithms are usually used to cluster populations of variables / data in different
            groups for multiple plausible reasons.<br>
            Reinforcement learning algorithms are where the machine is exposed to a training environment where it
            continually makes decisions using trial and error after learning from past decisions. This improves the
            accuracy of its decision making.<br>
            Now, let's move onto an overview of some of the algorithms:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Linear Regression: This is an example of Supervised learning algorithms. Given a set of data points of
                the dependent and independent variable, we try forming
                an equation of the form \(Y = mX + c\) where \(Y\) is the dependent variable, \(m\) is the slope of the
                line, \(X\) is the independent variable and \(c\) is the intercept. We derive the equation constants
                \(m\) and \(c\) by minimising the sum of the squared difference of distance between the data points and
                the regression line. This can be done as follows after reading the \(n\) data points: calculate four
                kinds of sums - \(\sum X\), \(\sum x^2\), \(\sum Y\) and \(\sum XY\). Then, calculate \(m\) by using the
                formula \(m = (n \times \sum XY - \sum X \times \sum Y) / (n \times \sum X^2 - \sum X \times \sum X)\)
                and
                \(c\) by using the formula \((\sum Y - m \times \sum X)/n\).
            </li>
            <li>
                Decision Tree: This is also an example of Supervised learning algorithms. In this algorithm, we look at
                some independent data points and classify them into two or
                more homogeneous sets. The main task is to make these sets as distinct as possible. There are two types
                of Decision Trees: categorical variable tree (definitive yes or no answers make up the tree. Ex: Will a
                person eat non vegetarian food?) and continuous variable tree (range of answers make up different sets
                in the tree. Ex: Human height). Let's look at one algorithm used for making Decision Trees called Gini
                algorithm: Let's say we have two input variables, gender and class, and we want to see which split would
                produce more homogeneous sub nodes for people that play cricket. Gini tells us to find the sum of
                squares of probability of success (\(p\)) and failure (\(q = 1-p\)) for the first proposed partition and
                calculate the weighted Gini score for it. Do the same for the second proposed partition and the
                partition with higher Gini score is the better way to partition the data points. For example, if the
                data given to you is the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There are 30 students. 10 females and 20 males. 14 \(9^{th}\) graders and 16 \(10^{th}\)
                        graders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2 females play cricket (0.2) and 13 males play cricket (0.65). 6 \(9^{th}\) graders play cricket
                        (0.43) and 9 \(10^{th}\) graders play cricket (0.56).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                We need to find whether a split on gender would be better or a split on class would be better.<br>
                For split on gender;
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Gini for sub node females = (0.2)*(0.2) + (0.8)*(0.8) = 0.68
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gini for sub node males = (0.65)*(0.65) + (0.35)*(0.35) = 0.55
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calculated weighted Gini score = (10/30)*0.68 + (20/30)*0.55 = 0.59
                    </li>
                </ol>
                For split on class;
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Gini for sub node \(9^{th}\) graders = (0.43)*(0.43) + (0.57)*(0.57) = 0.51
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gini for sub node \(10^{th}\) graders = (0.56)*(0.56) + (0.44)*(0.44) = 0.51
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calculated weighted Gini score = (14/30)*0.51 + (16/30)*0.51 = 0.51
                    </li>
                </ol>
                We can see that the Gini score for split on gender is more favourable, so we make the node split based
                on gender.
            </li>
            <li>
                K-means Clustering: This is one of the most widely used unsupervised ML algorithms. The objective of
                this algorithm is to group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To solve this,
                the algorithm searches for a fixed number of clusters (\(k\)) (cluster - collection of data points based
                on certain similarities) in a dataset. The algorithm gets its name because it finds \(k\) centroids in
                its approach. Essentially, what this algorithm does is given a set of data points, it divides the graph
                into multiple clusters by finding centroids for each cluster. A python library that can perform the task
                of finding the centroid is sklearn.cluster. However, if the data cannot be clustered efficiently, the
                data points need to be converted into points of a higher dimensions. Another approach of the algorithm
                is to generate \(k\) random centroids and assign each data point to its nearest centroid (by finding
                minimum Euclidean distance). After clustering all data points using the last step, we gather all points
                of a particular cluster and identify the actual centroid by taking the average of all points assigned to
                that cluster. We repeat this for all clusters. Now, we keep repeating the two previous steps until
                convergence is reached. One amazing application of K-Means clustering is to help an ecommerce giant like
                Samsung decide where it should open new stores in such a way that not too many stores are opened close
                to each other and the stores are not too far apart (for sales coverage reasons). Using the database
                which contains information about all the clients, Samsung can easily solve this problem using K-means
                clustering.
