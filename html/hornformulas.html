            My interpretation and analysis of the algorithm:
        </h1>
        <p>
            The whole concept of Horn Formulas and prolog (programming by logic) came from the need for computers to
            display some level of logical reasoning similar to us humans. Horn Formulas are a way to derive logical
            conclusions based on certain facts and rules provided to it. Let’s understand the basics of Horn Formulas by
            taking the example where the Horn Formula is a Boolean variable – it takes either true or false as a value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine the murder of a high ranking military general took place at his house.<br>
            Let variables \(u, v, w, x, y \ and \ z\) denote the following statements:
        <ul>
            <li>\(u\)→the colonel is innocent</li>
            <li>\(v\)→the wife is innocent</li>
            <li>\(w\)→the murder took place at 8 pm</li>
            <li>\(x\)→the murder took place in the kitchen</li>
            <li>\(y\)→the butler is innocent</li>
            <li>\(z\)→the colonel was asleep at 8 pm</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will call a variable \(x\) or its negation \(x'\) a literal. We have two kinds of clauses in Horn
            Formulas:
        <ol>
            <li>Implications – These clauses are of the form "If the conditions on the LHS hold, the conditions on the
                RHS must also be true by implication". Two examples from the example scenario: "\((z∧w) ⇒ u\)" means "if
                the
                colonel was asleep at 8 pm and the murder took place at 8 pm, the colonel is innocent." "\(⇒ x\)" is a
                degenerate type of implication which means "the murder took place in the kitchen". Implications lead us
                to setting some variables to true.</li>
            <li>Pure negative clauses – These clauses contain an OR of any number of negative literals. For example,
                "\((u’∨v’∨y’)\)" means "all three suspects can’t be innocent". Pure negative clauses lead us to setting
                some
                variables to false.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have understood the basic terminology with the help of an example, we move onto the
            technicalities. Our goal is to determine whether we can assign either true or false values to the variable
            that satisfies all the clauses. This is called the satisfying assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strategy to solve Horn Formulas:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Set all variables to false.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set some variables to true very carefully keeping implications in mind. While there is an implication
                that is not satisfied, set the variable on the RHS to true.
            </li>
            <li>
                Look at the negative clauses left and make sure the pure negative clauses are satisfied. If yes, we have
                a satisfying assignment. If no, the formula provided does not have a satisfying argument.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, we can show that this solution uses a Greedy approach to test for satisfying assignments because the
            two properties for Greedy Approach are satisfied in the 2nd phase of the algorithm – the first and third
            phase of the strategy are only for setting and checking. The two properties are as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Greedy Choice Property – We do know the first step towards the optimum solution. Set the first variable
                with the implication clause to true.</li>
            <li>Optimum Substructure Property – Once the first-step is taken, can we restate the rest of the problem as
                a smaller version of the original problem and thus, solve using recursion? Yes. The global final answer
                has to be built from the local answers for each implication.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, why is the strategy correct? Because, if the strategy returns an assignment, this assignment satisfies
            both the implications and the negative clauses and is thus a valid satisfying assignment of the Horn
            Formula. Now, we need to convince ourselves that if the strategy doesn’t return a satisfying assignment,
            there isn’t one anyways. This is due to the fact that if a certain set of variables is set to true, then
            they must be true in any satisfying assignment. Thus, if the truth assignment found after the 2nd phase
            doesn’t satisfy the negative clauses, there is no satisfying assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The structure of the code:
        <pre>
                <code>
void horn_formulas(char* formula)
{
    // apply regex to the formula and set all variables to false
    
    // while there is an implication that is not satisfied:
    //      set the RHS variable of the implication to true

    // if all pure negative clauses are satisfied:
    //    return the assignment
    // else:
    //      return ("Formula is not satisfiable");
};
                </code>
                </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s take an example dry run to understand this better. <br>
            Input: \((w∧y∧z) ⇒ x, (x∧z) ⇒ w, x ⇒ y, ⇒ x, (x∧y) ⇒ w, (w’∨x’∨y’), (z’)\). <br>
            Process: <br>
            First, set all variables \(w, x, y, z\) to false.
            Then,
        <ol>
            <li>
                set \(x\) to true because \(“⇒ x”\).
            </li>
            <li>set \(y\) to true because \(“x ⇒ y”\).</li>
            <li>set \(w\) to true because \(“(x∧y) ⇒ w”\).</li>
        </ol>
        Now, looking at the pure negative clauses, we see that the first one is not satisfied.<br>
        Output: Formula is not satisfiable.
        </p>

            Applications in different fields:
        </h1>
        <p>
            It is easy to see why Horn Formulas might be used in multiple fields. We provide a set of rules and it
            outputs a
            statement that satisfies the rules. It is an important part of Logic Programming which is used extensively
            in
            Computer Science because first order logic (set of axioms / rules) is well understood and can represent all
            computational problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Horn Formulas play a major role in various branches of Computer Science like Data Science, Machine Learning
            and
            so on. Why so? Universal Horn theories (set of Horn clauses) are exactly the framework in which the notion
            of
            any generic example can be applied. Horn Formulas are an improvement on the initial models used in logic
            programming and this is why Horn Theory is so popular.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since Horn Formulas are a special kind of Syntactic Unification (solving equations between symbolic
            expressions), they can be used in multiple areas of Computer Science that use Syntactic Unification. Some of
            these include: Theorem Proving, Natural Language Processing, Pattern matching, Scientific calculators,
            Expert
            Systems, Parsing and Query Languages.
