            My interpretation and analysis of the algorithm:
        </h1>
        <p>
            Huffman Encoding answers the question – what is the most economical way to encode a given long string in
            binary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s take an example: We want to encode a 120 million character string made up of the alphabets \(A, B, C,
            D,
            E, F, G \ and \ H\). The traditional approach to encode this in binary would be to assign a two bit binary
            number
            to each alphabet (\(A ⇒ 000, \ B ⇒ 001, \ C ⇒ 010 \ and \ D ⇒ 011, \ E ⇒ 100, \ F ⇒ 101, \ G ⇒ 110 \ and \ H
            ⇒ 111\)) and encode
            it to give us a total length of 360 million bits. Now, there must be a way to encode it better. How do we do
            it? Huffman Encoding is the answer. We try to do variable length encoding based on how frequently each
            alphabet appears in the string.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s say the frequency of occurrence of each bit is as follows:
        <div style="overflow-x:auto;" class="achiev">
            <center>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Alphabet</th>
                        <th>Frequency</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(A\)</td>
                        <td>24 million</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(B\)</td>
                        <td>45 million</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(C\)</td>
                        <td> 3 million</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(D\)</td>
                        <td>3 million</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(E\)</td>
                        <td>23 million</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(F\)</td>
                        <td>4 million</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(G\)</td>
                        <td>8 million</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>\(H\)</td>
                        <td>8 million</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </center>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, the Huffman Encoding algorithm tells us to proceed as follows to achieve variable length encoding of
            the string.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Build a priority queue that contains 8 nodes where each node represents the root of a tree with single
                node.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract two minimum frequency nodes (\(C\) ⇒ 3 million and \(F\) ⇒ 4 million) from the queue and add a
                new
                internal node with frequency 7 million.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract two minimum frequency nodes (\(D\) ⇒ 5 million and \((C+F)\) ⇒ 7 million) and add a new internal
                node
                with frequency 12 million.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract two minimum frequency nodes (\(G\) ⇒ 8 million and \(H\) ⇒ 8 million) from the queue and add a
                new
                internal node with frequency 16 million.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract two minimum frequency nodes (\((D+(C+F))\) ⇒ 12 million and \((G+H)\) ⇒ 16 million) and add a
                new
                internal node with frequency 28 million.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract two minimum frequency nodes (\(E\) ⇒ 23 million and \(A\) ⇒ 24 million) from the queue and add a
                new
                internal node with frequency 47 million.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract two minimum frequency nodes (\(((D+(C+F))+(G+H))\) ⇒ 28 million and \(B\) ⇒ 45 million) and add
                a new
                internal node with frequency 73 million.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract two minimum frequency nodes (\((E+A)\) ⇒ 47 million and \((((D+(C+F))+(G+H))+B)\) ⇒ 73 million)
                and add
                a new internal node with frequency 120 million.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            After performing these steps, the Huffman Tree will look as follows (Note: all frequency numbers are in
            millions):     
            <center> <img src="../img/huffmantree.png" style="  text-align: center;" width="759"></center>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, we have done a variable length encoding of the 120 million character string using Huffman Encoding.
            Now we see whether this actually provides an improvement on the total amount of bits required to encode.
            With the normal encoding scheme, we were able to encode the string in 360 million bits. Now, for Huffman
            Encoding, we get the total cost of the tree as follows – the sum from \(i=1\) to \(i=n\) of (frequency of
            \(i^{th}\) symbol
            × depth of \(i^{th}\) symbol in tree). Here, the calculation for that is as follows –
            (2×23)+(2×24)+(2×45)+(4×5)+(5×3)+(5×4)+(4×8)+(4×8) = 303 million bits. This is a 16% improvement on the
            encoding length.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let’s have a look at how the two Greedy Approach Properties are satisfied in this algorithm:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Greedy Choice Property – The two symbols with the smallest frequencies must be at the bottom of the
                optimal tree, as children of the lowest internal node. Why? It's simple. Because otherwise, swapping
                these two symbols with whatever is lowest in the tree would improve encoding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optimum Substructure Property – Define the frequency of any internal node to be the sum of the
                frequencies of its descendant leaves. The cost of a tree is the sum of the frequencies of all leaves and
                internal nodes except the root. Any tree in which \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) are sibling leaves has cost
                \((f_1+f_2)\) plus the
                cost for a tree with \((n−1)\) leaves of frequencies \((f_1+f_2), f_3, f_4 … f_n\). Using the greedy
                choice statement
                and applying it recursively, we affirm the optimum substructure property. Essentially, in every
                iteration, we remove the bottom two leaves and combine their frequencies to form the node which is their
                parent at \((n−1)\) level.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The structure of the code:
        <pre>
                <code>
void huffman_encoding(int f[])
{
    int n = sizeof(f);
    // f is an array of frequencies
    // Let H be a priority queue of integers ordered by f
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        // insert(H, i)
    }
    for (int k = n + 1; k <= 2 * n - 1; k++)
    {
        // i = deletemin(H), j = deletemin(H)
        // create a node numbered k with children i, j
        // f[k] = f[i] + f[j]
        // insert(H, k)
    }
    // return Huffman tree
};
                </code>
                </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The time complexity of the Huffman algorithm is \(O(n \log n)\). Using a heap to store the weight of each
            tree,
            each iteration requires \(O(\log n)\) time to determine the cheapest weight and insert the new weight. There
            are \(O(n)\) iterations, one for each item.
        </p>

            Applications in different fields:
        </h1>
        <p>
            It is easy to imagine the potential use cases of Huffman encoding. Let's try to list down some generic real
            life applications of encoding a piece of information.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Data compression: This is a very common use case of encoding which is used by the whole world in this
                day and age.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Audio and video streaming / uploading is only possible due to compression techniques like
                        mp3, jpeg, mpeg4 and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Large pieces of data can easily be stored and transferred in computer networks using processes
                        like ZIPing files and RARing files. These are a result of encoding data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The concept of barcodes and QR codes is possible only due to the process of encoding. It allows us to
                easily access data that we might need instead of performing manual operations to access that chunk of
                data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Encoding standards like ASCII and UTF help encode computer understandable formats to human readable
                characters for making computer data human readable. Emojis are also a result of such encoding and
                decoding protocols.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiple different types of codes like morse code and gray code use digital encoding and were popular in
                the last century.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Huffman encoding, as proven during the course of this article, is more efficient than a lot of the standard
            encoding methods and for this reason, it is used often when it comes to any type of encoding. GZIP, JPEG and
            PNG formats heavily use Huffman encoding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple communications with and from the internet are Huffman encoded at some point. Multiple communication
            protocols use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Huffman encoding, combined with Dynamic Programming, also serves as the basis of lossless compression
            algorithms like Brotli Compression (released by Google).
