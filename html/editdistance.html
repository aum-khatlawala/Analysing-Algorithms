            My interpretation and analysis of the algorithm:
        </h1>
        <p>
            This algorithm deals with the problem of the closeness of two strings. Now, a good measure of closeness of
            two strings is the extent to which they can be aligned. So, the edit distance problem deals with the
            question – how many minimum edits (insertions, deletions and substitutions / conversions) are required to
            convert one
            word to another. Let’s take an example. To convert the word "Saturday" to "Sunday", we need 3 minimum edits.
            This
            can be visualised as follows:
            \[SATURDAY\]
            \[S--UNDAY\]
            So, we delete \(A\) and \(T\) and convert \(R\) to \(N\) to get "Sunday" from "Saturday".
        </p>
        <p>
            We could easily identify the optimal answer in this case, however, there could be multiple non optimal ways
            to reach the answer. How do we write an algorithm for the minimum answer? Based on the example, we can say
            that the problem boils down to finding the best alignment for the two words given and then finding how many
            places the letters don’t match in. We can also observe that the two properties required for the Dynamic
            Programming Approach are satisfied for this kind of a problem:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Overlapping Subproblems Property: solutions of the same subproblems are needed again and again. This can
                observed if we try to write a recursive algorithm to solve this. This is because we can reach the same
                subproblem from two different tree paths while writing the recursive algorithm to solve this.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optimal Substructure Property: optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using optimal
                solutions of its subproblems. How? This is what we shall understand now.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p> We want to find the edit distance between two strings \(x\) (with length \(m\)) and \(y\) (with length
            \(n\)). The
            subproblem
            can be to find edit distance between some prefix of the first string and some prefix of the second string.
            This
            can be written as \(E(i, j)\) where the prefix for the first string is \(x[1...i]\) and the prefix for the
            second
            string
            is \(y[1...j]\). If we keep finding the answers to such subproblems, we end up with our final answer \(E(m,
            n)\).
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s provide the intuition to solve the \(E(i, j)\) subproblem. There are three possible cases:
        <ol>
            <li>The \(i^{th}\) letter of the first string is aligned with a dash.</li>
            <li>A dash is aligned with the \(j^{th}\) letter of the second string. </li>
            <li>The \(i^{th}\) letter of the first string is aligned with the jth letter of the second string. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            We can express \(E(i, j)\) in terms of smaller subproblems. <br>
            \(E(i, j) = \min \{ 1 + E(i − 1, j), 1 + E(i, j − 1), diff(i, j) + E(i − 1, j − 1) \}\). <br>
            This might look like a gigantic complicated formula, but it is rather simple to understand. <br>
            The minimum edit distance for the subproblem is equal to the minimum out of the three where \(1 + E(i − 1,
            j)\)
            is
            for the first case (we need to find minimum distance for the smaller subproblem \(E(i-1, j)\) and add 1 to
            it
            because the \(i^{th}\) letter of the first string is aligned with a dash indicating a mismatch), \(1 + E(i,
            j − 1)\) is
            for
            the second case (we need to find minimum distance for the smaller subproblem \(E(i, j - 1)\) and add 1 to it
            because the \(j^{th}\) letter of the second string is aligned with a dash indicating a mismatch) and
            \(diff(i, j) +
            E(i − 1, j − 1)\) is for the
            third case (we need to find minimum distance for the smaller subproblem \(E(i - 1, j-1)\) and add 1 if the
            \(i^{th}\)
            and \(j^{th}\) letter of the respective strings aren't the same and add 0 if the \(i^{th}\) and \(j^{th}\)
            letter of the
            respective strings are the same).
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, we only need to decide the base cases. \(E(0, j)\) is the edit distance between the 0-length prefix of
            \(x\),
            namely the empty string, and the first \(j\) letters of \(y\): clearly, \(j\). And similarly, \(E(i, 0) =
            i\).
        </p>
        <p>
            The structure of the code:
        <pre>
                <code>
int editdistance(const char *word1, int m, const char *word2, int n)
{
    int E[m + 1][n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
    {
        E[i][0] = i;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
    {
        E[0][j] = j;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
        {
            // E(i, j) = min{E(i − 1, j) + 1, E(i, j − 1) + 1, E(i − 1, j − 1) + diff(i, j)}
        }
    };
    return E[m][n];
}
                </code>
                </pre>

            Applications in different fields:
        </h1>
        <p>
            Computers have become such an important tool for studying human and other animals' genes that computational
            genomics has become a new field in itself. Here are some examples of common questions that arise in this
            realm:
        <ol>
            <li>
                When a new gene is discovered, one way to learn more about its function is to look for known genes that
                are similar to it. This is especially useful for transferring knowledge from well-studied species, such
                as mice, to humans. The basic idea of the search problem is to see how closely two gene strings match. A
                generalisation of edit distance and Dynamic Programming can be used to effectively compute it. There is
                also another problem of searching through gene databases like GenBank. This is done using methods like
                BLAST, which is a combination of algorithmic tricks like the ones used in edit distance and biological
                concepts. This has led to it being the most widely used computational biology software.
            </li>
            <li>
                DNA sequencing methods include DP algorithms as the fragment sizes are around 500-700 characters long
                (with the property of Overlapping Subproblem) and they need to be assembled into a coherent DNA sequence
                of billions of these.
            </li>
            <li>
                The concept of phylogenetic tree and its computation methods (after gene sequencing) is also something
                that can be solved using computational biology softwares.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Edit Distance is also used in finding out how similar a set of DNA / protein sequences are and this forms
            the basis of methods like UPGMA which find the phylogenetic relationship between different species.
        </p>
        <p>
            Autocorrection models can also be improved using the algorithm for Edit Distance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approximate string matching, where the objective is to find matches for short strings in many longer texts,
            also uses edit distance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hirschberg's algorithm uses the concept of minimising edit distance to compute the optimum alignment of two
            strings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Levenshtein automata are finite state machines that recognize a set of strings within bounded edit distance
            of a fixed reference string.
