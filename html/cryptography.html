            We shall talk about the basics of encryption. Encryption is a method of converting data into an
            undecipherable format so that only the authorized parties can access the information. Cryptographic keys are
            used along with encryption algorithms to make the process of encryption possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of encryption methods based on the way the cryptographic keys are applied – Symmetric
            encryption (aka private key encryption) and Asymmetric encryption (aka public key encryption).
        </p>
        <p>
            First, let’s talk about Symmetric Encryption. As the name implies, it uses a single cryptographic key to
            encrypt and decrypt data. The most primitive use of Symmetric Encryption was proposed by Julius Caesar
            (Caesar’s cipher). Let’s imagine a situation where Alice wants to send an encrypted message to Bob using
            this protocol but wants to make sure that an eavesdropper, Eve, can’t decipher the message. To do this,
            Alice and Bob meet up beforehand and choose a secret codebook with rules for deciphering the encrypted
            message. Let’s say that the codebook is very straightforward and has the only rule as "each letter in the
            encrypted message is replaced by a letter 10 positions down the alphabet". Now, using this, if Alice sends a
            message to Bob, Eve will only be able to decipher the message by partially using some encoded messages to
            figure out the codebook. Although this was a simple example, it helps in giving us the basic understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            We shall talk about one kind of Symmetric Encryption scheme called the one-time pad. In this scheme, Alice
            and Bob meet up beforehand and select a string \(r\) of the same length as the message Alice plans to send
            later
            on.<br>
            Now, to encrypt the message, Alice takes a bitwise XOR of each bit in the message with the corresponding
            bit in the string \(r\). Let’s say the message she wants to send is 11110000 and the string \(r\) is
            01110010.<br>
            The
            encryption function will work as follows: \(e(x) = x⊕r\) = 11110000⊕01110010 = 10000010. Now, the reason
            this
            works is because if we apply the encryption function again, we get the original message.<br>
            How? \(e(e(x)) =
            (x⊕r)⊕r = x⊕(r⊕r) = x⊕0’ = x\) (where 0’ is a string of all zeros with the same length as \(r\) and thus,
            the same
            length as \(x\)). Therefore, to decrypt, Bob just needs to apply the encryption function to the encoded
            message.<br>
            Now, how will this stop Eve from intercepting the message? Simple. Bob and Alice should pick \(r\) at random
            in
            such a way that the resulting string is equally likely to be an element of \(\{ 0,1 \}^n\). This will ensure
            that if
            Eve intercepts the message, she gets no information about \(x\).<br>
            Let’s understand with an example. If Eve
            finds
            out that the encrypted message is 10, she won’t be able to deduce \(x\) because \(r\) could be designed for
            any 2
            bit binary \(x\) string (00, 01, 10 and 11) because 00⊕10=10, 01⊕11=10, 10⊕00=10 and 11⊕01=10. Thus, there
            are
            multiple possible options for \(x\) if one only knows its encoded message.<br>
            The downside of the one-time pad is that it has to be discarded after one use – this is how it gets its
            name. This is because if Eve intercepts two encoded messages – \(x⊕r\) and \(z⊕r\) – for the two messages
            \(x\) and \(z\),
            she could take the bitwise XOR of the two encoded messages to get \(x⊕z\), which might give her important
            information like – do the two messages begin or end the same (due to XOR properties) and if one message
            contains a long sequence of 0s, the corresponding part of the other message could be exposed (\(b⊕0=b\)
            where \(b\)
            is either 0 or 1).
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, if Alice and Bob agree on a shared 128 bit random string r and it specifies a bijection from 128 bit
            strings to 128 bit strings along with the property that the encryption function can be used multiple times,
            then this kind of Symmetric Encryption scheme is called the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The only way
            to break the code of encryption at present is through brute force approach and that makes it highly unlikely
            to break the code if the shared random string r is selected correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, we move onto Asymmetric Encryption. Consider the example we talked about at the start. If Bob wants to
            communicate with hundreds of people securely using the private key encryption protocol, it wouldn’t be too
            practical as he would have to maintain a detailed list of which key corresponds to whom. To resolve this
            issue, the concept of public key encryption was introduced. In this scheme, Bob gives a public key to
            everyone who sends him messages and keeps a private key to himself. The encryption is done through the
            public key and the decryption is done through the private key.
        </p>
        <p>
            For public key encryption, we want a representation which can be encrypted fast but which has slow / almost
            impossible public key decryption and fast private key decryption. To enable this kind of public key
            encryption, an ingenious protocol called the Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) algorithm was formulated.
        </p>
        <p>
            The RSA algorithm relies heavily on number theory. Think of the message that you want to send as numbers
            modulo \(N\) where messages larger than \(N\) can be broken into smaller pieces. The encryption function
            will be a
            one to one and onto mapping on \(\{ 0, … N-1 \}\) and the decryption function will be the inverse mapping.
            Now, we
            move onto the two essential properties for the RSA algorithm. Pick two primes \(p\) and \(q\) such that
            \(pq=N\). For
            any \(e\) relatively prime to \((p-1)(q-1)\):
        <ol>
            <li>
                The mapping \(x→x^e \mod N\) is a bijection on \(\{ 0, … N-1 \}\). <br>
                This property tells us that the mapping is a reasonable mapping for the encoding process of the message
                \(x\), since no information is lost. Using this property, Bob can publish \((N, e)\) as his public key.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let \(d\) be the inverse of \(e \mod (p-1)(q-1)\). Then for all \(x∈ \{ 0, … N-1 \}, (x^e)^d ≡ x \mod
                N\). <br>
                This property tells us how decryption can be achieved. The secret key, \(d\), can be retained by Bob and
                he
                can simply use the formula given to decode his message.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Before moving onto the proof of the properties, let’s look at an example of the RSA scheme:
            Let \(N\) = 39 = 3 · 13. Choose \(e\) = 5 since it is relatively prime to 24 (= (3-1)·(13-1)). The
            decryption
            exponent is then the inverse of (\(5 \mod 24\)) = 29 (because (5·29) mod 24 = 1). This can be computed using
            the
            Extended Euclid’s Algorithm. Thus, for any message \(x \mod 39\), the encryption of \(x\) is \(y = x^5 \mod
            39\) and the
            decryption of \(y\) is \(x = y^{29} \mod 39\). For example, if \(x\) = 11, \(y = 11^5 \mod 39\) = 20 and
            \(x\) = 11 = \(20^{29} \mod 39\).
        </p>
        <p>
            Proof of the two properties:<br>
            If the mapping \(x→x^e \mod N\) is invertible, it must be a bijection. Thus, the second property implies the
            first property. We prove the second property. \(E\) is invertible modulo \((p-1)(q-1)\) because it is
            relatively
            prime to that number. Now, we examine the equation \((x^e)^d ≡ x \mod N\). We observe that since \(ed ≡ 1
            \mod
            (p−1)(q−1)\) (property of modulo inverse), \(ed = 1+ k(p-1)(q-1)\) for some value of \(k\). Now we need to
            show that
            the difference \((x^e)^d – x = x^{(1+ k(p-1)(q-1))} – x\) is always \(0 \mod N\). Now, we use Fermat’s Little
            Theorem.
            It states that if \(p\) is a prime, then for every \(1 \leq a \leq p\), \(a^{(p-1)} ≡ 1 (\mod p)\).
            The second form of the equation is divisible by \(p\) (since \(x^{p-1}≡ 1 (\mod p)\)) and likewise by \(q\).
            Since \(p\) and
            \(q\) are primes, it must also be divisible by \(N\) (their product). Thus, \(x^{(1+ k(p-1)(q-1))} – x ≡ 0
            (\mod N)\). This
            completes our proof.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, we will show how secure this scheme is: <br>
            The claim is as follows: Given \(N\), \(e\) and \(y = x^e \mod N\), it is computationally intractable to
            determine \(x\).
            Why? Two reasons:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Finding \(x\) would require the brute force method of checking whether \(x^e ≡ y \mod N\) and this would
                take
                exponential time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Factoring \(N\) to retrieve \(p\) and \(q\) and then figuring out d using the Extended Euclid’s
                Algorithm would be a
                very hard process because factoring is assumed and proven to be hard.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Thus, intractability is what the RSA scheme takes advantage of to remain secure.
