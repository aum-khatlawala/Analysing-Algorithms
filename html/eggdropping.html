            My interpretation and analysis of the algorithm:
        </h1>
        <p>
            The puzzle is as follows:<br>
            Imagine there are 2 eggs and a building with 100 floors and we want to know which stories of the building
            are
            safe to drop eggs from. What is the least number of egg droppings that will help us find the answer to the
            question?<br>
            We make a few assumptions:
        <ol>
            <li>
                If an egg survives the fall, it can be used again.
            </li>
            <li>
                A broken egg is discarded.
            </li>
            <li>
                All eggs are identical in terms of effect of a fall.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an egg breaks on the \(i^{th}\) floor, it'll break from all floors above the \(i^{th}\) floor.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an egg doesn't break on the \(i^{th}\) floor, it won't break on a floor lesser than the \(i^{th}\)
                floor.
            </li>
            <li>
                No assumptions are made about either the \(1^{st}\) floor or the \(100^{th}\) floor.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we move onto understanding the solution, let's look at a property of this puzzle that will help us
            understand the approach easily.<br>
            This is the Optimal Substructure Property:
        <ol>
            <li>
                If the egg breaks after dropping from the \(x^{th}\) floor, then we only need to check the lower floors
                with the remaining eggs. Therefore, the problem reduces to \(x-1\) floors and \(n-1\) eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the egg doesn't break after dropping from the \(x^{th}\) floor, then we only need to check for higher
                floors. Therefore, the problem reduces to \(k-x\) floors and \(n\) eggs.
            </li>
        </ol>
        We proceed keeping these two properties in mind and also keeping in mind that we have to deal with the worst
        case scenario at every stage and then find the minimum possible number of trials. So the problem can be
        remodeled as follows:
        \[egg\_drop(n, k) = 1 + \min \{ \max(egg\_drop(n-1, x-1), egg\_drop(n, k-x)) \}\]
        </p>
        <p>
            If we try solving the problem using recursion, the approach would be as follows:<br>
            Let's say we have two eggs and two floors. Let's try throwing the egg from the first floor.<br>
            We have two cases:
        <ol>
            <li>
                If the egg breaks from the first floor, then the first floor is the threshold floor. So, the egg needs
                to be dropped from 0 floors to minimise the total number of trials.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the egg doesn't break from the first floor, then we only need to test the second floor to get the
                answer. So, the answer becomes 1.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Thus, for the first floor, \(egg\_drop(2, 1) = 1 + \max(0, 1) = 2\).<br>
        Now, if we try throwing from the second floor, we have two cases:
        <ol>
            <li>
                If the egg breaks from the second floor, then we will have 1 egg and 1 floor (second floor) to find the
                threshold.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the egg doesn't break from the second floor, then the egg needs to be dropped from 0 floors to
                minimise the number of trials (because there are only 2 floors).
            </li>
        </ol>
        Thus, for the second floor, \(egg\_drop(2, 2) = 1 + \max(1, 0) = 2\).<br>
        Thus, the total answer is 2 as it is the minimum value from 2 and 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was the recursive method of solving the problem. But if we try to visualise this approach for higher
            number of floors, we realise that there are many values in the recursion tree being computed multiple times.
            This means there is an Overlapping Subproblem Property to this problem too. This increases the time
            complexity of the recursive algorithm to exponential time. We can solve this hurdle by using memoisation in
            a Dynamic Programming approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            The approach will be to maintain a matrix / table with the results of all subproblems as and when we
            calculate the answer to a subproblem. For example, to fill the \((i,j)^{th}\) entry of the matrix (where
            \(i\) is the number of eggs and \(j\) is the number of floors for that subproblem), we traverse for each
            floor \(x\) from 1 to \(j\) and find the minimum of the following expression: \((1 + \max( matrix[i-1][j-1],
            matrix[i][j-x]))\).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is best to understand this by visualising the matrix.<br>
            Let's say we have 2 eggs and 6 floors. The matrix will be as follows (with each row corresponding to an egg
            and each column corresponding to a floor):
            \[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 3 \end{bmatrix}\]
            How do we get this?<br>
            The first row is straight forward to fill as for one egg, the minimum number of attempts
            to find out from which floor the egg will break (in the worst case scenario) is the number of floors
            itself.<br>
            It gets trickier for 2 floors. Let's go through it step by step.<br>
            For 2 eggs and 1 floor, the number of eggs is more than number of floors, it doesn't help and we just copy
            the value given in 1 egg and 1 floor entry.<br>
            For 2 eggs and 2 floors, I have explained the reasoning earlier. The answer is 2.<br>
            For 2 eggs and 3 floors;<br>
            if we drop from first floor and it breaks, we have 0 as the answer. If it doesn't break, we have 2 floors
            and 1 egg to work with. To find this, we refer to the \((1,2)^{th}\) entry of the matrix and see the answer
            is 2. So, \(1+\max(0,2) = 3\).<br>
            if we drop from the second floor and it breaks, we have 1 floor and 1 egg to work with, so the answer is 1
            (\((1,1)^{th}\) entry). If it doesn't break, we have 1 floor and 2 eggs to work with, so the answer from the
            matrix is 1.
            So, \(1+\max(1,1) = 2\).<br>
            if we drop from the third floor and it breaks, we have 2 floors and 1 egg to work with, so the answer is 2.
            If it doesn't break, we have 0 as the answer. So, \(1+\max(2,0) = 3\).<br>
            So the \((2,3)^{th}\) entry is \(\min(3, 2, 3) = 2\).<br>
            For 2 eggs and 4 floors;<br>
            Dropping from the first floor \(\rightarrow\) Egg breaks \(\rightarrow\) 0 and if egg doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 3 floors and 2 eggs to work with \(\rightarrow\) 2. So, \(1+\max(0,2) = 3\).<br>
            Dropping from the second floor \(\rightarrow\) Egg breaks \(\rightarrow\) 1 floor and 1 egg to work with
            \(\rightarrow\) 1 and if egg doesn't break \(\rightarrow\) 2 floors and 2 eggs to work with \(\rightarrow\)
            2. So, \(1+\max(1,2) = 3\).<br>
            Dropping from the third floor \(\rightarrow\) Egg breaks \(\rightarrow\) 2 floors and 1 egg to work with
            \(\rightarrow\) 2 and if egg doesn't break \(\rightarrow\) 1 floor and 2 eggs to work with \(\rightarrow\)
            1. So, \(1+\max(2,1) = 3\).<br>
            Dropping from the fourth floor \(\rightarrow\) Egg breaks \(\rightarrow\) 3 floors and 1 egg to work with
            \(\rightarrow\) 3 and if egg doesn't break \(\rightarrow\) 0. So, \(1+\max(3,0) = 4\).<br>
            So the \((2,4)^{th}\) entry is \(\min(3, 3, 3, 4) = 3\).<br>
            For 2 eggs and 5 floors;<br>
            1 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 0 and doesn't break \(\rightarrow\) 4 floors and 2 eggs
            \(\rightarrow\) 3. So, \(1+\max(0,3) = 4\).<br>
            2 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 1 floor and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 1 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 3 floors and 2 eggs \(\rightarrow\) 2. So, \(1+\max(1,2) = 3\).<br>
            3 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 2 floors and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 2 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 2 floors and 2 eggs \(\rightarrow\) 2. So, \(1+\max(2,2) = 3\).<br>
            4 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 3 floors and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 3 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 1 floor and 2 eggs \(\rightarrow\) 1. So, \(1+\max(3,1) = 4\).<br>
            5 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 4 floors and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 4 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 0. So, \(1+\max(4,0) = 5\).<br>
            So the \((2,5)^{th}\) entry is \(\min(4, 3, 3, 4, 5) = 3\).<br>
            For 2 eggs and 6 floors;<br>
            1 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 0 and doesn't break \(\rightarrow\) 5 floors and 2 eggs
            \(\rightarrow\) 3. So, \(1+\max(0,3) = 4\).<br>
            2 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 1 floor and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 1 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 4 floors and 2 eggs \(\rightarrow\) 3. So, \(1+\max(1,3) = 4\).<br>
            3 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 2 floors and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 2 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 3 floors and 2 eggs \(\rightarrow\) 2. So, \(1+\max(2,2) = 3\).<br>
            4 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 3 floors and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 3 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 2 floors and 2 eggs \(\rightarrow\) 2. So, \(1+\max(3,2) = 4\).<br>
            5 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 4 floors and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 4 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 1 floor and 2 eggs \(\rightarrow\) 1. So, \(1+\max(4,1) = 5\).<br>
            6 \(\rightarrow\) breaks \(\rightarrow\) 5 floors and 1 egg \(\rightarrow\) 5 and doesn't break
            \(\rightarrow\) 0. So, \(1+\max(5,0) = 6\).<br>
            So the \((2,5)^{th}\) entry is \(\min(4, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 3\).<br>

            Applications in different fields:
        </h1>
        <p>
            There aren't too many applications of the Egg Dropping Puzzle except in Psychological studies and a few
            other domains. It is similar to the Tower of Hanoi problem in terms of both being puzzles but it isn't as
            famous as the Tower of Hanoi problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Egg Dropping puzzle, however, is a very interesting puzzle and is thus used for many cognitive ability
            tests and it is also an interview question for Computer Science students.
